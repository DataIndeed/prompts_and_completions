{"prompt":"There are two relevant data trends.","completion":"Data is expected to grow from 33 ZB (zettabytes) today to 175 ZB in 5 years . And the cloud 2is moving to the edge for performance and availability, driven by IoT applications, multi-player gaming, autonomous vehicles,and content streaming. Decentralization would accelerate this change and adoption, as it lowers deployment, management, andscale-out cost. To this end, 0Chain is decentralizing storage.0Chain dStorage is cheaper and higher performance than traditional cloud."}
{"prompt":"The protocols provide a layer of privacy, security,transparency, and service assurance.","completion":"For consumers, the benefits are privacy, anonymity, and transparency. Developers havebetter customer data protection at a lower cost. Enterprises can scale out their data protection at a lower cost. For MSPs, dStorageprovides a higher revenue potential.The dStorage platform is built on 0ChainNet, a permission-less, fast finality, scalable blockchain, built from scratch in Golang.0ChainNet protects its network from Sybil with a Nonlinear Proof-of-Stake protocol, and prevents blockchain stalls from DDoSattacks by using multiple leaders."}
{"prompt":"Client protection is accomplished by using a Serverless 2FA protocol for individuals, and acryptographic multiple signature protocol for exchanges and businesses.0ChainNet offers innovative token economics which enables users and developers to get \u201cfree\u201d services, such as transactions andstorage.","completion":"Users can lock ZCN tokens , like a bank CD, to get interest tokens immediately. Storage providers (\u201cblobbers\u201d) need to 3stake ZCN tokens to receive expected payment. As more applications use our network, ZCN will grow in its intrinsic valuerelative to the data stored on the network, and tokens locked for interest, as users interactively lock and stake tokens to participatein the ecosystem. In this sense, ZCN is the first crypto asset tied to data and interest.Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other projects, 0Chain inflation is primarily driven by token holders desire to mint \u201cinterest\u201dtokens, which are given to token holders for locking or staking their tokens, rather than \u201creward\u201d tokens given to miners only.0Chain has recently re-tooled its token economics to provide on-going rewards to support the community of developers andambassadors as well."}
{"prompt":"In addition, 0Chain has allocated a portion of team tokens to fund the reward tokens for the first 4 yearsafter mainnet to maintain low inflation.","completion":"After 4 years, the rewards will be generated by the network and the interest will be set at5% to maintain an average target inflation rate of about 3-4%. This provides benefits to the entire ecosystem - miners, developers,ambassadors, and token holders at a low inflation rate.1 dStorage PlatformThe motivation behind the design of the platform is to offer a cheaper, faster, more secure and more available storage thantraditional cloud. Let\u2019s discuss some inherent challenges with offering such a service in a decentralized environment.a) How to protect against data loss?b) How to ensure that even if one or some of the decentralized parties are down, the overall service is not effected for everysingle stored file or object?c) How to make certain that the decentralized parties are really storing the data for which they are getting rewarded?d) How to avoid currency fluctuation for our managed storage provider (MSP) customers?e) How do dApps preserve data consistency among multiple parties to execute their smart contracts?Some challenges are inherent and relatively new to the decentralized systems. Below, we will explore each of these challengesand the approach 0Chain dStorage has taken."}
